          When you are looking at a website, it is most likely that your browser
          will be receiving HTML and CSS from the web server that hosts the
          site. The web browser interprets the HTML and CSS code to create the
          page that you see. Most web pages also include extra content such as
          images, audio, video, or animations and this book will teach you how
          to prepare them for use on the web and then how to insert them into
          your web pages. Some sites also send JavaScript or Flash to your
          browser, and you will see how to add JavaScript and Flash in your web
          pages. Both of these technologies are advanced topics that you can go
          on to learn more about once you have mastered HTML and CSS, if you
          want to.

          We will spend the first chapter looking at how HTML is used to create
          web pages. You will see that you start by writing down the words you
          want to appear on your page. You then add tags or elements to the
          words so that the browser knows what is a heading, where a paragraph
          begins and ends, and so on. The rest of this section introduces the
          tags you have at your disposal to create web pages, grouped into
          chapters on: text, lists, links, images, tables, forms, video audio
          and flash, and miscellaneous elements. I should warn you that the
          examples in the first nine chapters are not exciting to look at, yet
          they are the foundation of every web page.

          The following chapters on CSS will show you how to make your pages
          look a lot more interesting. We start this section with a chapter that
          explains how CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling and
          layout of web pages. We then go on to look at the wide variety of CSS
          properties you can use in your CSS rules. These properties generally
          fall into one of two categories: Presentation: How to control things
          like the color of text, the fonts you want to use and the size of
          those fonts, how to add background colors to pages (or parts of a
          page), and how to add background images. Layout: How to control where
          the different elements are positioned on the screen. You will also
          learn several techniques that professionals use to make their pages
          more attractive.

          We end up with some helpful information that will assist you in
          building better websites. We look at some new tags that will be
          introduced in HTML5 to help describe the structure of your pages.
          HTML5 is the latest version of HTML (still under development at the
          time of writing). Before learning about these elements, you need a
          good grasp of how CSS is used to control the design of web pages.
          There is a chapter that talks you through a design process that you
          might like to follow when creating a new website. Finally, we end up
          looking at topics that will help you once you have built your site,
          such as putting it on the web, search engine optimisation (SEO) and
          using analytics software to track who comes to your site and what they
          are looking at.

          <h4>Browsers</h4>
          People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular
          examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and
          Opera. In order to view a web page, users might type a web address
          into their browser, follow a link from another site, or use a
          bookmark. Software manufacturers regularly release new versions of
          browsers with new features and supporting new additions to languages.
